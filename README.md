# Yelp Client Demo

Time spent: 7 hours spent in total


 * Search results page
   * [x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height
   * [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints
   * [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
   * [ ] Optional: infinite scroll for restaurant results
   * [ ] Optional: Implement map view of restaurant results
 * Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters are supported in the Yelp API.
   * [ ] The filters you should actually have are: category, sort (best match, distance, highest rated), radius (meters), deals (on/off).
   * [ ] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
   * [x] You can use the default UISwitch for on/off states.
   * [ ] Optional: implement a custom switch
   * [ ] Radius filter should expand as in the real Yelp app
   * [ ] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand. Category list is here: http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/category_list (Links to an external site.)
   * [ ] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
   * [ ] Optional: Implement the restaurant detail page.
